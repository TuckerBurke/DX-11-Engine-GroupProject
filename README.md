## Documentation
I created this game for my Interactive Media Development course at RIT. This was my first project assembled in Unity and was coded using C#. 
The sprites were hand drawn with ink on tracing papaer for Inktober. The purpose of the assignment was to utilize vector forces for controls 
and physics. I recently added a bit more juice and functionality to the prototype to flesh it out as a portfolio piece.
