# DX-11 Engine Group Project
## About
This was our final group project for Game Graphics Programming at RIT. The course focused on the Direct X render pipeline
and GPU mapping in C++. You can download and play the build [here](x64/Release/DX11GroupProject.zip) if you would like to play.
## Documentation
Throughout the semester, we built and expanded a DirectX 11 Render / Game Engine in C++. For our final project, we used our engine
to make a little game experience. This is a stealth style game. Beyond the basic engine implementation, which all students in the
course shared, my contribution to this project included: the flashlights (attenuated spotlights) in the pixel shader, and the vignette 
shader and post-process. I am rebuilding this engine from scratch in another project to include ambient occlusion and to leverage
RTX cards for real-time lighting.
